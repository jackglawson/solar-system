# TO DO

Track heat of bodies by measuring GPE lost

plot collision rate for different params - can we make it constant?

how to stop it from collapsing? - give it a probability of frictionless elastic collision?

repulsion?

give it realistic units

remove escaped particles

analyse time to collapse for different distributions

make different types of galaxy

black holes - high density

astro fluids - density distribution of a galaxy?


## TODAY:

time analysis on octree

smarter octree - do we have to recreate it every time. can we just make some adjustments?

LEARN C++

simulate spiral galaxy - different densities
