# N-body simulation

Simulates the trajectories of N massive particles under the effects of gravity and inelastic collisions.

v1 and v2 are two separate implementations. Both are broadly similar but v1 is mostly Python and v2 is mostly C++.

Algorithms demonstrated:

- Adaptive RK4 integration
- Sweep and prune
- Octree
